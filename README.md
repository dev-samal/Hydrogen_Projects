# H2 Production Around the World
### Hydrogen Fuel Cells (HFCs) are part of many global sustainability programs. HFCs produce no harmful emissions because the only by products are heat and water, greatly reducing the risk of mismanagement and accidents with storing toxic material like battery acid or diesel fuel. 

Today, hydrogen is primarily used in industrial processes, such as rocket fuel, electricity generation, and powering vehicles. In the United States, hydrogen is used for various refinement processes, production of fertilizer and chemicals, production of renewable diesal, etc. Hyrdrogen power is among the many sustainable solutions for large manufacturing corporations of steel or chemical seeking to reduce carbon footprint. Current research in transition of HFCs has shown increased energy efficieny, lower operational costs, and durability in extreme weather environment. 

While HFC's are new and exciting, infrastructure, funding and much time is required before significant transitions are made among the general population of HFC's. This dataset and app simply explores the current interest in hydrogen production via electrolysis, natural gas reforming, etc. The is app reflect that many countries are budgeting and planning to begin there own hyrdrogen production programs to build enviromental sustainability.
